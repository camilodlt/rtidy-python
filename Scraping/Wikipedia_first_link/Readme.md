# Do all roads lead to rome? Not in wikipedia at least, they lead to Philosophy

Some days ago I saw a short ad in youtube (from Curiosity) that stated that if you follow every first link of a topic in wikipedia you always will end up in Philosophy. Most of the words end up at some point in Science and Science leads to Philosophy. 

I found that observation very interesting, I tried first manually and it worked! So I decided to make a more robust observation. The code is still far from perfect, wikipedia has a lot of particularities for some topics (citations, spellings, ...) but I managed to check it out for some words: 

## Science leads to Philosophy
