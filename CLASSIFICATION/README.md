# CLASSIFICATION TASKS ARE DISPLAYED HERE. 

Some tasks focus on the data, some on the models and the rest on the language. 

## JULIA_MLJ 

The folder JULIA_MLJ focus primarily on the **language** and the **packages**.

The idea is to gain a better understanding of Julia and also to become familiar with the package MLJ who seems to be the best scikit-like package for machine learning. 

I try to follow the [tutorials or labs](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/). Sometimes the code is the same, other times I make significant changes and do not follow the same route.
I found very useful information here: 
- [Package documentation](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/)
- [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)

### Notebooks  

- [**Wine's classes**](../blob/main/CLASSIFICATION/JULIA_MLJ/Wine.ipynb)

Wine's classes was infered by KNN and Logistic regression using MLJ and other packages.  
Results are great altough not the main the iterest.   
In particular we got to train a **multi-label classifier** and **coerce the scientific types** to more suitable types.
