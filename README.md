I've recently started to put here script of some projects as a way to showcase code, possibly help others and reference (mostly for myself in the future) some techniques. 

I will try to break down the repository by topics. I believe most topics will cover Kaggle datasets, book exercises and Tidytuesdays' datasets. 

Some of the scripts available at rtidy-python.com are available here.  

I'll try to make a github page at some point and switch the website there since it's just an static webpage (in order to free ressources at GPC).
